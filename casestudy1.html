                    We developed in the early stages of the design process and used to map out the structure and basic
                    layout of the website or app. We were exploring different design concepts and variations. Develop of
                    wireframes help us to focus on the layout and navigation of the website or app, without getting
                    bogged down in details such as colors and typography.

                Once the lo-fi wireframes have been created and reviewed, we could move on to creating higher-fidelity
                wireframes that include more details and visual elements.

                <h1>Usability Testing: Rosulate</h1>
                <p class="usability_p1">To evaluate the usability of the prototype, I conducted usability testing with a
                    total of 5 participants. The testing was conducted both in-person and remotely, and I made detailed
                    observations of each participant's interaction with the prototype. For each participant, I created
                    transcripts that captured any mistakes, slips, or confusions they experienced during the testing
                    process. By analyzing these observations, I gained valuable insights into areas where the prototype
                    could be improved to provide a better user experience.</p>

                    By conducting user testing, we were able to identify areas for improvement and make visual
                    enhancements to the product. Specifically, we added different images, implemented scrolling cards,
                    and upgraded the navigation bar with a hamburger menu. These changes were made with the goal of
                    enhancing the user experience and making the product more visually appealing and user-friendly.

                <p>We chose a style guide inspired by the Eucalyptus Forest, with a color palette based on shades of
                    green to represent trees. The background color was black, as it creates an immersive experience that
                    allows users to fully engage with the website and experience a range of emotions.</p>
